# Singapore-Property-Resale-Prices


Project aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict property resale prices in Singapore with Python Scikit-learn library.


In this project, we do the following:
1. Download public housing resale data in Singapore
2. Perform data cleaning
3. Perform exploratory data analysis
4. Engineer new features
5. Apply machine learning techniques to train a model to predict housing resale prices

Get into our Jupyter notebook to see how each step was performed!
